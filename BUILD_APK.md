## 📱 Build APK — Step by Step

### Step 1: Login to Expo (one-time setup)
Open terminal in the `custruction_app` folder and run:
```
npx eas-cli login
```
Then enter your Expo account email + password.
> If you don't have an Expo account, go to: https://expo.dev/signup

### Step 2: Build the APK
```
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```
This uploads code to Expo's cloud servers and builds a `.apk` file.
Build takes ~10-15 minutes.

### Step 3: Download the APK
When done, EAS will show a download link like:
```
✓ Build finished. Artifact URL: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/...apk
